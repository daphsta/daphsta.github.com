A Newbie month at my local Ruby meetup has encouraged me to give a talk for the first time. It was definitely nerve wrecking considering
I've only been coding in Ruby for a little over a year now. After submitting the topic of my [talk](https://github.com/BrisRuby/meetups/tree/master/2014-11-24),
there was no turning back and I have to give my best shot.

Coincidentally, I came across a blogpost regarding [giving technical talks](https://www.reinteractive.net/posts/225-thoughts-on-doing-technical-talks) by [reInteractive](https://www.reinteractive.net/)
which I found really encouraging and gave me a further boost of confidence. This has been really helpful to me and I would like to add my thoughts
and experiences on why every developer should attempt to give technical talks and how to minimize the fear and trepidation.

##### There's no benefit to me in giving talks

##### Coming up with a topic to speak on makes you think

As developers, I know we do a lot of thinking and probably do it all day and even in our sleep (certain problems do get solved in our sleep).
However, coming up with a topic to speak makes you think in an entirely different perspective. It takes a bit of work to identify an area of interest,
a problem that you have solved, or just general experience and compose a talk out of it. To help ease the process, writing your ideas
in [Trello](http://www.trello.com) at the end of the day is a start. You can then narrow down on what might interest you (and your potential audience) to warrant
further research.

##### But my topic is too trivial and everyone knows about it

##### What if I can't answer every question by the audience

##### You don't need x amount of years of experience to be able to give talks

##### I get too nervous doing public speaking

##### Live coding

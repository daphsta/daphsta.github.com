A Newbie month at my local Ruby meetup has encouraged me to give a talk for the first time. It was definitely nerve wrecking considering
I've only been coding in Ruby for a little over a year now. After submitting the topic of my [talk](https://github.com/BrisRuby/meetups/tree/master/2014-11-24),
there was no turning back and I have to give my best shot.

Coincidentally, I came across a blogpost regarding [giving technical talks](https://www.reinteractive.net/posts/225-thoughts-on-doing-technical-talks) by [reInteractive](https://www.reinteractive.net/)
which I found really encouraging and gave me a further boost of confidence. This has been really helpful to me and I would like to add my thoughts
and experiences on why every developer should attempt to give technical talks and how to minimize the fear and trepidation.

##### How does it benefit me by giving talks

We love challenges and public speaking is a big challenge for the majority of the society. By overcoming a challenge, you build character and a certain amount of immunity towards fear, in this case, fear of public speaking. The ability to speak in front of a small crowd gives you confidence when communicating with team mates and clients on a day to day basis. That, can be nutured over time by overcoming the fear of speaking. 
We have also probably heard about this, time and again that speaking forces you to research a subject matter thoroughly and as a result, you would understand it initimately which is beneficial for your development as a coder.

##### Coming up with a topic to speak on makes you think

As developers, I know we do a lot of thinking and probably do it all day and even in our sleep (certain problems do get solved in our sleep).
However, coming up with a topic to speak makes you think in an entirely different perspective. It takes a bit of work to identify an area of interest,
a problem that you have solved, or just general experience to compose a talk out of it. To help ease the process, writing your ideas
in [Trello](http://www.trello.com) at the end of the day is a start. You can then narrow down on what might interest you (and your potential audience) to warrant
further research. Of course, it will be more adventurous to give a talk on a subject you don't really know about but would like to understand it in more. For starters, it would be best to talk about something you are working on or have worked with and perhaps it could benefit part of the audience.

##### But my topic is too trivial and everyone knows about it

##### What if I can't answer every question by the audience

##### You don't need x amount of years of experience to be able to give talks

##### I get too nervous doing public speaking

##### Live coding

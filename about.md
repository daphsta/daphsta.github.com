[Rails Girls] (http://www.railsgirls.com) Brisbane advocate and Ruby Developer (I did it!). My blog helps me reflect on what I've been learning and my experience in building apps (with Ruby of course). I am happy and very keen to connect with people of similar interest and motivation. :D Hit me up via [email] (mailto:yiingshan@gmail.com?subject=Hey,I read your blog) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/daphsta) to say hi.
